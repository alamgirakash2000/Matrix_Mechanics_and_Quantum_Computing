<h1 align="center"> Matrix Mechanics and Quantum Computing </h1>

This repository is a part of the course - ***[Online Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Computing: Theory, COMSOL Simulation & Coding](https://sites.google.com/view/onlinecoursebymdy/quantum-mechanics-quantum-computing-theory-comsol-simulation-coding?authuser=0)***. Here I have stored all the necessary code that was taught during the course, also the final assignment on Qiskit of the course.
